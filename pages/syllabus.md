<h3> Course Description </h3>
<p align="justify"> This course will introduce trainees to concepts of statistical computing in data manipulation and preparation and its applicability to health data science. Participants will be introduced to several data science methods and techniques in a sequence of lectures and practical exercises involving computer applications using relevant real data sets in the health domain.
  
<!--
  In <b>week 2</b> participants will be engage in advanced deep learning techniques with real-life applications in public health. </p>

<h3> Learning Objectives </h3>
<p align="justify"> At the end of the two weeks, participants would be able to apply the following deep learning methods and techniques to their health datasets or health domain of their interest: </p>

1.	Understand deep learning notations, terminologies, and performance metrics.
2.	Use neural network architecture, mluti-layer perceptrons, backpropagation, and regularization techniques.
3.	Understanding the CNNs models and their applications to public health domain.
4.	Use RNNs and their application to climate and time series health data.
5.  Understanding the transformers and transfer learning and model building in health data.
6.	Properly compare models using appropriate statistical approaches for fair model comparison.
7.	Interpret deep learning results and write reports on them. -->
